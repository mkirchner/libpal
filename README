-=[ Introduction ]=-

Libpal is inteded to be an easy-to-use packet assembly library. It provides
an interface consinsting of several functions which can be found in packet.h.
Documentation is located in doc/. Still not enough, but should get most people
started. Please contribute!

-=[ Constraints ]=-

At the moment the only supported platform is Linux/i386. I hope this will soon
change. 

-=[ How to compile ]=-

On Linux/i386:

	To change installation target directory, please edit the
	PREFIX variable in "Makefile". Default is /usr/local
	Using "make" both, shared as well as static libraries will
	be built and installed.
	Use "make shared" or "make static" if you want only shared/
	static libs to be built.

	make
	su -
	make install

On other platforms: 	1. modify code until it works
			2. modify Makefile
			3. compile
			4. test
			5. mailto: kirchner@stud.fh-heilbronn.de
			6. or join libpal development @ sourceforge
			7. thanks.
